## GameBoy w/ React

### About

A concept for the GameBoy, intended for possibly creating small playable games. It might still change into a React Native / Mobile application. Responsiveness is not yet fully functional. The buttons are clickable and the screen 'turns on' when the start button is pressed.

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
